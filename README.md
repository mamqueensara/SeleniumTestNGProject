# 🚀 Selenium Automation Framework (AutomationPractice + DemoWebShop)

## 📌 Overview  

This project is part of my Selenium automation learning journey.  
I automated key e-commerce functionalities using two public test websites:  

- **AutomationPractice**
- **DemoWebShop**

The goal of this project is to build a **real-world Selenium Test Automation framework** using industry-standard practices such as **Page Object Model (POM), TestNG, Maven, WebDriver utilities, Listeners, and Screenshots**.

✔ Page Object Model  
✔ Page Factory  
✔ Base Test  
✔ Driver Manager  
✔ Config Reader  
✔ Utilities  
✔ TestNG Listeners  
✔ Screenshot on Failure
